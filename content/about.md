## Section 1: Our Story

### The Beginning (2018)
Founded in Tokyo by a team of engineers who experienced firsthand the hidden cost of cultural misalignment. After watching talented teams fail not because of skills, but because of cultural friction, we asked a simple question: What if AI could understand culture as well as humans do?

### The Research (2018-2021)
We spent three years studying 50,000 successful placements across 47 countries. We interviewed 5,000 hiring managers, analyzed millions of data points, and discovered that 95% of hiring failures weren't about technical skills—they were about cultural fit.

### The Breakthrough (2021)
Our 47-Dimensional Cultural Intelligence Engine was born. Unlike traditional assessments that rely on 4-6 dimensions, we mapped human behavior across 47 scientifically validated dimensions, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting cultural fit.

### Today (2025)
aiKODA powers cultural intelligence for 200+ organizations globally, from startups to Fortune 500 companies. We've assessed over 50 million candidates, saved companies $500M in hiring costs, and helped build teams that don't just work—they thrive.
